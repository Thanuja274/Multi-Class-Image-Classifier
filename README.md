This project is a multi-image classification system built using machine learning and AI, where images are organized into category-specific folders for training. The model learns to recognize different categories based on this structured dataset. Once trained, users can upload any image, and the system will automatically predict and display the category it belongs to. Ideal for tasks like object recognition or content sorting, this project demonstrates the practical use of supervised image classification with a simple and user-friendly interface.
